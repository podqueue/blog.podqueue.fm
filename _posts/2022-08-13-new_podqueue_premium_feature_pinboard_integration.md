title: "New PodQueue Premium feature: Pinboard integration"
---

[PodQueue Premium](https://podqueue.fm/pages/pricing) now supports automatically synchronizing all of your saved links to the third-party bookmarking service [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in)!

Any existing links you have saved in PodQueue will be synchronized with their original save date when you first configure the integration, and any new links will automatically be saved to Pinboard as well, with an optional tag you can specify. Synchronization uses your Pinboard "add bookmarks as private by default" setting to determine if links saved to Pinboard are saved as public or private.

You can configure your Pinboard integration settings for PodQueue by going to ["Pinboard Integration" in your PodQueue account settings](https://podqueue.fm/users/pinboard).
